### What is this?
This repository is a trimmed down (contains only technical information, no projects/news/links) version of the RollerCoaster Tycoon Technical Depot. (which is no longer live)

In more detail, this repository contains file formats, checksum methods, and encoding/encryption methods used in Roller Coaster Tycoon 1, 2 and 3, as well as Locomotion.

### Why do pages only show up as HTML source code?
This repository is not intended to be a live website. Nevertheless, if you clone this repository with git (or the helpful "download zip"), you can explore the pages locally as a website.

Alternatively, you can view a live mirror (thanks LordAro) [here](http://freerct.github.io/RCTTechDepot-Archive/).

### Credits
The original content (and the original website) is copyrighted by James Hughes (aka DoctorJ). 
All credit for the information within these archived pages goes to him and numerous other contributors.

### Status and contributing
The documenting of the various file formats used within RCT 1/2/3 and Locomotion is still an ongoing process.
If you think something is missing, is incorrect, or can be done better, feel free to send a pull request.

Overall, RCT 1 is relatively well documented, while RCT2, RCT3, and Locomotion are lacking in many parts.
