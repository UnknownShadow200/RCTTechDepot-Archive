Each tile in a maze is divided into four sections. Mazes are stored as a
sequence of four byte elements. Each sequence describes a single tile. The
first byte is the X-axis position of the tile. The second byte is the Y-axis
position of the tile. The third and forth bytes are a word with the bits
mapped as follows:

If a bit is set, that part of the maze is solid. The large squares (bits
3, 7, 11 and 15) are set along with the surrounding bits for a solid section.
<P>
The tile which contains the entrance to the maze will have 08 for the fourth
byte and either 00, 01, 02 or 03 for the third byte, depending on which direction
it faces.[00 - connects to maze on the entrance's west side; 01 - connects
on North; 02 - East; 03 - South]
<P>
The tile which contains the exit from the maze will have 80 for the forth
byte and the third byte will be either 00, 01, 02 or 03 as above.
