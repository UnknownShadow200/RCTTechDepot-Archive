<P>
The TD6 file stores RCT2 track design information. The file is in compressed
format from a <A HREF="RLE.html">Run-Length-Encoding</A> algorithm. The last
four bytes are a <A HREF="Checksum.html">checksum</A>. The decoded files
can be either 19,235 or 24,735 bytes long. <BR>
The decoded format is as follows:
<P>
00 <A HREF="ridecodes.html">Track type</A>Note: "Ride" type is determined
by vehicle type
<P>
01: ?
<P>
The next four bytes flag "special" track pieces. These pieces are not always
available to the user as they may not have been researched. These items
correspond to the <A HREF="Menutables.html" TARGET="RideFeatures">Ride
Features</A> table used within the game.<BR>

  TRACK DATA
</H2>
<P>
There are two formats: one for <A HREF="Mazes.html">mazes</A> and one for
everything else (coasters, trains, cars etc.) The "coaster" format is as
follows:
<P>
Each track element has two bytes. The first byte indicates the type of
<A HREF="Trackelements.html">track segment</A> while the second byte is a
<A HREF="TrackQualifier.html">qualifier</A>. The track data concludes when
a value of "FF" is encountered for the track segment.
<P>
<P>
  <HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
  SCENERY ITEMS
</H2>
<P>
The track data is followed by three-word structures to specify entrances/exits.
The first word is flags with bit 7 being set for exits. Bits 0 and 1 specify
the direction the item points. The next word is the X offset (from the beginning
of the track), with each tile being 32 units. This is followed by a similar
value for the Y offset. A value of FF for the first byte indicates the end
of these structures.
<P>
Mazes do not have the station information described above - they simply have
a double word of zero between the track data and the scenery items described
next.
<P>
Scenery items follow the entrance/exit structures. Scenery items are described
in a twentytwo byte structure. The end of scenery items is flagged by a FF
for the first byte.
<P>
00: Flag: upper nibble indicates the version of the scenery item (0=custom,
8=original RCT2, 1=WW, 2=TT). the lower nibble indicates the type of scenery
object. 1 for single tile item, 2 for multiple tile item, 3 for wall, 5 for
path/queue, etc

01: ?

02: ?
<P>
03: ?
<P>
04..0B : text name of corresponding objdat file (ie the name of the scenery
item)
<P>
0C..0F: checksum of DAT file
<P>
10: X location (in tiles)<BR>
11: Y location (in tiles)<BR>
12: Z location<BR>
13: bits 0,1: direction; bits 2,3: quadrant - or part of third color<BR>
14: first color<BR>
15: second color
