<H1 ALIGN="Center"> CSS0.DAT FILE FORMAT </H1>
<H5><A HREF="index.html">Back to RCT home</A> </H5>
<P> The css0.dat file stores information about the scenarios. I have only
inspected the file that I have so I can only presume that all files use the
same codes. In original RCT, the file was named sc.idx.</P>
<P>The file is RLE compressed and contains a <A
HREF="checksum.html">checksum</A>. The version number corresponding to the SV4
file is used for the checksum. The file is encrypted by adding 39393939 and
then rotating each DWord right 5 bits.</P>
<P> 0000..7FFF : 128 entries of 16 bytes each. Contains the name of the
scenario file in the directory.<BR>
0800..27FF : 128 entries of 64 bytes each. Contains the name of the scenario. 
<BR>
2800..29FF : 128 entries of DWords for the company value (dollars multiplied by
ten). 80000000 for &quot;not won&quot;<BR>
2A00..39FF : 128 entries of 32 bytes each. The name of the winner.<BR>
3A00 : Number of scenarios<BR>
3A01 : Flag:<I> usu 0; purpose unknown.</I><BR>
3A02,3 : part of creation time of <B>css1.dat</B> file on your computer -
second word if original RCT or AA/CF, third word if LL.<BR>
3A04..3A07 : low DWord of sum of FileSize of all SC4 files in scenarios
directory.<BR>
3A08..3A0B : high DWord of sum of FileSize of all SC4 files in scenarios
directory.<BR>
3A0C..3A1B : 128 bit flags. A bit is reset whenever the scenario becomes
available. In original RCT, there were only 32 bits of flags - the remaining 12
bytes are not present.</P>
<P>There is also a checksum for the last scenario availability flags. it is
stored as a DWord at 2CA7 (this is in the area for the name of the winner of
the MegaPark scenario - since it is a &quot;have fun&quot; scenario, it should
not have a name entered.</P>
