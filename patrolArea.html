<P><A HREF="SV4.html">Back to SV4 documentation</A> Thanks to Dave Ryalls for
the following information: </P>
<H1 ALIGN="Center"> Patrol Area Map </H1>
<P>1F06AA..1F42A9 is the Patrol Area Map.</P>
<P> In the game, the park staff can be made to work in specified patrol
areas.<SPAN STYLE="mso-spacerun: yes"> </SPAN>Each individual Patrol Area
&#147;blueprint&#148; segment that can be laid down is an area of 4 by 4 tiles.
Given that the map is stored as 128 by 128 tiles, the patrol area for each
staff member is a maximum of 32 by 32 blueprint segments. For each member of
staff, 128 bytes in this memory area are allocated to flag whether or not each
of the 32 by 32 segments is in that staff member&#146;s patrol area. Each bit
in the 128 bytes represents one of the segments, with 32 bits representing one
row of blueprint segments, and 32 columns of 32 bits.. The memory is allocated
whether or not the staff member is given a patrol area. There are 120 sets of
128 bytes. The last 4 sets are used to store the combined patrol areas for each
of the staff types. Here, a bit is set if one or more staff member has the
segment in his patrol area. The first set of 128 bytes (at address 1F40AA) is
the patrol area for all the handymen, the second for all engineers, the third
for all security and the last for all entertainers. (Note that this structure
places a limitation on the game. It is impossible to employ more than 116 park
staff!) Following this (from address 1F42AA), there are 116 bytes used as flags
to indicate which of the 116 sets of 128 bytes are in use. For each byte: Bit 0
is set if there is a member of staff associated with the set of 128 bytes Bit 1
is set if the member of staff has been assigned a Patrol Area. </P>
